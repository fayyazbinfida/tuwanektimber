                  Tuwanek is a small oceanfront community tucked away at the end of Sechelt Inlet Road. Approximately 4 km past Porpoise Bay Provincial Park.

                  Pull into the driveway and find a bright yard, flowering bushes, tall trees, and a welcoming cabin.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The cabin has two floors, big front deck with propane BBQ, as well as a back yard patio which has a 6-person hot tub and fire pit.

                <li>
                  Enjoy the hot tub nestled in the tall trees in the back yard, or sit with friends watching the humming birds, while preparing your dinner.

                  It’s a great cabin, sitting on 1/3 of an acre with a pretty front yard that has cherry trees, cedar, dogwood and lots of birds. Peek-a-boo view of Sechelt Inlet from the front deck.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are two beaches within walking distance to choose from. Lamb’s Brook is a 5-minute walk from the cabin and a perfect place to launch a kayak or canoe. Tuwanek Beach is a 10-minute walk from our cabin and is a well-known scuba diving location.
                </li>
